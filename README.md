# Buyonic

"Group/Community Buying"  -> The biggest reason small businesses have higher costs is because of the scale. When they buy raw materials from suppliers, the quantity will be small so they don’t get discounts large companies get. This makes it harder for them to compete. Develop a platform where multiple businesses can post their requirement anonymously (in case there are competitors on the platform) and the platform can aggregate the requirement and place a single order to a supplier to get a better price. This kind of community buying will help small businesses get a better price. It can have 2 step email and phone OTP veriﬁcation to log in. The challenge is to aggregate the different requirements based on item type, or brand, and location. Buying multiple different items from the same manufacturer will also give a discount (it doesn’t have to have the same item code).
